    <h2 class="sub-title">Being a Test</h2>
    <p>I'm 20 years old, studying at <i>University of Sciences - Ho Chi Minh city Viet Nam National University</i>. I love geology since I went here. Everything is really exciting, I get learnt about the Earth and things that happened inside it over years. Doing a lot of experiments about geology, see what normal people hard to see like oil sample or gemstone.</p>
    <p>But <b>"designer"</b> is a different story.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-title">The path to be a Designer</h2>
    <p>Being a designer was my dream when I was young. I like sketching things around me, thinking about the way colors make thing look so amazing and attractive, the way they mix together. Those are reasons why I go on both, being a <strong>Geologist</strong> and a <strong>Designer</strong>.</p>
    <p>I will not mention much about geology here (cause this page is to store my art-work). I will only write down here things about designing hope it will help someone going freelance just like me.</p>
